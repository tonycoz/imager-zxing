1.002
=====

 - expose all of the boolean decoder hints.

 - re-work to take better advantage of ExtUtils::ParseXS's support for
   C++ (hopefully no function changes)

 - rename decoder and result object accessors to match the C++ APIs,
   this is mostly from like_this() to likeThis().  The old method
   names continue to be available for now but they are now silently
   deprecated.
   They will start warning from some future release, and be removed
   from some later release.

1.001 - 13 Sep 2023
=====

 - re-work std::string handling to use the typemap

 - fix "decoder" -> "decode" in the SYNOPSIS

 - support all Imager image layouts

 - require a recent enough ExtUtils::CppGuess and set the required C++
   standard

 - allow the zxing-cpp package name for pkg-config, which seems to be what
   packagers used before upstream decided on "zxing.pc".
